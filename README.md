## What is the TechLadies Bootcamp #3?
TechLadies is a community for women in Asia to connect, learn, and advance as programmers. One of our main programs, the oversubscribed TechLadies Bootcamp, is back!

Held in Singapore, the TechLadies Bootcamp is a 12-week part-time accelerated learning program designed for women who wish to be professional programmers. Ladies are guided by industry experts to create products for nonprofit organizations. 30% of the graduates received technical internships and/or were hired as junior software engineers.

The next TechLadies Bootcamp will run from 29 Jul - 14 Oct 2017 teaching the Ruby programming language. [Read more about the TechLadies Bootcamp #3 at this link.](http://www.techladies.co/techladies-bootcamp-3)

## What is the TechLadies Bootcamp #3 - Pre-Bootcamp Workshops?
We learned that it is important for TechLadies Bootcamp participants to have some sort of programming foundation in order to build a web product that will be used by the NGOs. Hence, you will need to [complete a technical task outlined at this link](https://github.com/TechLadies/technical-task) before applying to the TechLadies Bootcamp.

This series of workshops aim to help you acquire the skills you need to complete the task with this series of workshops.
